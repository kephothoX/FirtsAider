# Flask API Service

This is a minimal Flask API service starter based on [Google Cloud Run Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy/deploy-python-service).

## Getting Started

- Update `.env` with your credentials.
- Install all packages on `requirements.txt`

Server should run automatically when starting a workspace. To run manually, run:
```sh
./devserver.sh
```
